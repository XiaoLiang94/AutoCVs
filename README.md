# AutoCVs

## Automated CV measurements under various experimental conditions 

# Description
This code is for conducting automated CV measurements with real-time adjustments of various experimental conditions, including temperature, electrolyte composition, concentration, and flow rate. This code also includes the features, including in-situ electrode cleaning and removal of bubbles generated during the measurements, to address challenges encountered in electrochemical measurements.

# Hardware devices required
* Four pressure pumps (Flow EZ™, Fluigent)
* Four flow rate sensors (FLU-M+, Fluigent)
* A multi-switch valve (M-SWITCH™, Fluigent)
* A 2-switch valve (2-SWITCH™, Fluigent)
* An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments)
* A CMOS camera (MS-XG903GC/M, Minsvison)
* A water bath (ARCTIC A10 with a SC150 controller, Thermo Scientific)

# Python packages required 
Fluigent.SDK (for Fluigent devices control)
hardpotato (for electrochemical workstation control)





# A schematic of the automated workflow
